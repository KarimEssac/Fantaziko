following the same style, theme, colors and font of the rest of the project, I want you to create "match-points.php" page, study the db structure I attached inside the db.txt to know the exact db structure implemented, then make all function necessary to administrate the match points.
To be clear, this page should administrate the points distributed to all players in a certain league, for example, if a player scored a goal, and his role is mid, we should see how much the midfielder score is in the table for this league, and it should be added, we can see all the history of a player in this page and so on

I've attached players.php, which is the players management page in our admin's dashboard (contains different styles and color ignore the style just study how it works and for what)
in this page the owner of the league should be able to select players in teams and manage them, and also see their stats, like what's existed in player.php (study it carefully)
user should first select a team from the list of all the teams existed, then see the list of all players, (show their position if the positions column is 'positions' not 'positionless', and their price if system column is 'Budget')
make the user able to create new players in this page
